# restql
## Motivation

The project aims to remove the boilerplate code in writing a web application. The JavaScript library is model after the Python `sqlalchemy` library. Because of this, you could use JavaScript to interact with the database through the `sqlalchemy`-flavored API. In Python, you can create an API server by just passing in the `sqlalchemy` model.

## Python server
For now, please run `python model.py` in the `restql` folder to generate a sample SQLite database. Then the server can be start with `python view.py`.
